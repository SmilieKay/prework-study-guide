#<"Prework Study Guide">

## Description

I was motivated to make this Prework Study guide to help me and possibly others learn coding. I built this project as a way to get hands on practice coding. It helped me get started having real life experience making my own webpage. I have learned so much by doing this project. I have learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I have learned about Command line codes and GitHub uses.
